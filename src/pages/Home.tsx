                We met during a rainy evening in November 2018 at a local coffee shop. Sarah was working on her laptop while John was meeting a friend who never showed up. Fate had other plans that day.

              <p className="mb-4">
                After three years of adventures, travels, and building a life together, John proposed during a surprise weekend getaway to the mountains. The rest, as they say, is history.
