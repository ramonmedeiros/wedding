Expect beach days, bloco parties, caipirinhas, and maybe even a night at the SambÃ³dromo.\n\nImportant: Hotels are booking up fast, so we recommend reserving your accommodations as soon as possible!\n\nIf you want a more relaxed vibe after the Carnaval craziness, we definitely suggest staying a few extra days to enjoy some calmer beach time or explore other parts of Brazil â€” itâ€™s the perfect way to recharge! ðŸŒ´ðŸŒž\n\nRough plan:\n* Feb 16â€“19 â€“ blocos, beach, street parties, and general good chaos\n* Feb 20 â€“ farewell breakfast near the hotel\n\nWe seriously canâ€™t wait to celebrate with you all and this is just the beginning! ðŸ’•\nLetâ€™s make it unforgettable! ðŸŒžðŸ’ƒðŸ•º\n"
