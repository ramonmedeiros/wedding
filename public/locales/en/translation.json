Whether you're down for the full Carnival experience or just want to enjoy the vibes by the beach, we can't wait to celebrate with you. 🌞💃🕺",

So bring out your best suits, gowns, cocktail dresses, polished shoes, and a touch of glam. ✨\n\nThe celebration will be mainly indoors, with a bit of outdoor space. Since it’s February in Brazil, think warm weather and breathable fabrics.\n\nColor-wise, feel free to get creative! All colors are welcome, including black (it is technically the funeral of our single lives, after all 😄).\n\nJust one little favor: please avoid white and beige tones. Not because we don’t love them, but because the bride would really like to be the only one glowing in those shades. Let’s not compete with her spotlight moment, okay?\n\nFor some extra comfort later on, bring your flip-flops for the party! 💃🕺\n\nWe can’t wait to celebrate with you, in style!",
